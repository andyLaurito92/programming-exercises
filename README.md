Collection of programming exercises. I use this repo for reminders on how to solve different problems



## String Problems
1.  Basic String Manipulation:

*   Valid Anagram (check if two strings are anagrams)
*   Remove Character to Make String Equal
*   One Edit Distance (check if two strings are one edit away)
    
2.  Character Count/Comparison:

*   First Unique Character in a String
*   Find All Anagrams in a String
*   Minimum Window Substring
    

3.  Two Pointer String Problems:

*   Compare Version Numbers
*   Backspace String Compare
*   Long Pressed Name
    

4.  Pattern Finding:
    
*   Find and Replace Pattern
*   Group Shifted Strings
*   String Compression
    

Key concepts to focus on:

*   String comparison techniques
*   Finding all possible solutions (not just one)
*   Efficient character matching
*   Two-pointer approaches
