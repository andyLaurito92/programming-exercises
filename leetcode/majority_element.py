# Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

# The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

# This can be solved in O(N) & O(1) space by using the
# the Boyer-moore majority vote algorithm
