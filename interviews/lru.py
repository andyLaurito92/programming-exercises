"""
Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. 
It should support the following operations: get(key) and put(key,value) where key is an integer and value is a positive integer.
 
 
get(key) Get the value of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return something indicating that itâ€™s missing.
put(key, value) Set the value if the key is not already present or update it if it is. When the cache is at capacity, (i.e., it is full), it should evict (i.e., remove) the Least Recently Used item before inserting a new item.
 
 
The cache is initialized with a positive capacity
"""

"""
First thing to think about: If capacity is a small-medium number, then it means that we might consider
a constant time to go through the whole lru cache! If that is the case, then the easiest thing to do
is just to use a normal dict and evict in linear time

"""
Let's now say that we do not have a small capacity. We need to be efficient on
our operations: What could we do?

Idea: Keep in a double linked list the least recently used keys. Every time you
need to evict, you use this linked list to get the key that needs to be removed
from the dict which is the first node

For getting a value, we need to update the timestamp of a node in the list. The
trick here is to store in the dictionary the node of the linked list. By doing this,
we access the node in O(1). This node we move it to the end of the list in O(1) operation.

double linked list and by storing the node in the dictionary
- Think of storing objects that can help you w/the problem u need to solve
(store a node instead of a key-value pair)
- The timestamp is implicit in the double linked list structure: Every time
you do a get/put operation, you are updating a (key, value) pair which means
move the node to the last. For evicting, just remove the first node
